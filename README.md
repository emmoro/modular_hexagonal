## APP - Project developed in modular hexagonal architecture 
Project developed to explore architectural principles, this project was did in modular hexagonal, and has been used the designer pattern Structures and Chain of responsibility
</br>

## Modular hexagonal
* modular hexagonal - The hexagonal architecture is based on independent and well-defined modules, which facilitates the maintenance and evolution of the system. Each module has clear responsibilities and can be developed, tested and replaced in isolation, without impacting the rest of the system.
</br>

## Designer pattern Structures
* Structural is concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures. The structural design patterns simplifies the structure by identifying the relationships. These patterns focus on, how the classes inherit from each other and how they are composed from other classes.
</br>

## Designer pattern Chain of responsibility
* The Chain of Responsibility design pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows requests to be passed along a chain of handlers until one of them processes them.
